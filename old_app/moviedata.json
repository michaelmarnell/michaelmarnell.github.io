The four screenwriters' literate script of Biro's adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she's married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we've seen earlier. Olivier can't believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn't, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn't know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years.

Lyolya, Dmitriy's girl friend, feels that their relationship means little to him and decides to marry their best friend, theoretician Ilya Kulikov. Learning that Dmitriy's life is in danger, however, she realizes that she loves him, and they marry despite his misgivings. From the outset of the marriage, Dmitriy's singular devotion to his work keeps them apart. At a Siberian research center, Dmitriy works together with Ilya, and though Ilya's cynical manner is so different from his own, their disagreements do nothing to mar their friendship and mutual respect. As a new success is obtained, Dmitriy is again exposed to radiation. He persuades Ilya to keep the accident a secret until the experiments are completed. Lyolya, misunderstanding Dmitriy's remoteness, feels that she has failed as a wife. Dmitriy's health deteriorates, and, aware of his doom, he makes a visit to his family. At a Moscow clinic he asks doctors to perform an experimental bone marrow transplant with little chance of success. Ilya comes to visit him on the day before the operation and tells him that their experiments produced a new type of radiation which was not thermonuclear, as anticipated, but nonetheless would be an important contribution to science.
